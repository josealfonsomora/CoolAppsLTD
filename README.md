# Cool Apps LTD

Cool apps Ltd. wants to make an app that shows you some details about a social network you are a part of. They hope that showing a customer this data in a cool way will highlight if the customer is getting any value from the network. They’d like you to build a simple prototype of this app.

## What they need:

A native **Android** app that allows a user to login with Facebook and show some stats about the things that they like e.g. books, music, films, etc.

### The app should have:
* A screen that allows a user to “Login with facebook” and also logout.
* A screen that shows the users basic information from Facebook (name, email, profile pic, anything else you may want to display)
* A screen showing some information about one category of items they like e.g. films (no need to do many categories here. Pick one of films, music or books).

> The information shown about the category is up to you but here are some examples:
> “You like a lot of bands from Dublin”
> “60% of the films you like star Tom Cruise”
> “You read a lot of books written by Robert Ludlum”

* Unit tests
